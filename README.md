# CoCEd-DM #

A save editor for the game *Corruption of Champions*. Now featuring a dark mode!

CoCEd-DM allows you to edit your character's stats, appearance/body, perks, items, etc.

<br>

***The Dark mode is not 100% complete and the main reason is that xaml is utter garbage and some things just don't work. I won't release any further changes unless it is a rewrite with html and css for the ui.***


## Requirements ##

Requires, at least, Windows XP (which means it also works with: Vista, 7, 8, and 10) and the .NET Framework 4 (full or client profile).

Not currently compatible with Mac OS X and Linux (even if using Wine or Mono).


## Installation ##

**Windows XP Note:** Users of Windows XP *must* install, at least, the [Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17113 "http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17113"), if you have not already done so.
